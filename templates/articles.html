        <h3 class="article-title">The Importance of Sleep Hygiene</h3>
        <p class="article-summary">Good sleep isn't just about feeling rested. It supports memory, boosts immunity, and improves emotional balance. Learn practical tips to create a better bedtime routine.</p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Sleep is a cornerstone of overall health, as important as diet and exercise. During sleep, your body repairs itself and your brain consolidates memories and processes information from the day. A lack of quality sleep can lead to a host of problems, including weakened immunity, poor concentration, and increased risk of chronic diseases.
            <br><br>
            **Tips for better sleep:**
            <ul>
                <li>**Maintain a consistent schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.</li>
                <li>**Create a relaxing environment:** Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.</li>
                <li>**Limit screen time before bed:** The blue light from screens can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep.</li>
                <li>**Watch your diet:** Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol close to bedtime.</li>
                <li>**Get regular exercise:** Physical activity can improve sleep quality, but avoid strenuous workouts right before bed.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="article-title">Mindful Eating: Savoring Every Bite</h3>
        <p class="article-summary">Mindful eating is a practice that encourages you to be present with your food. Discover how to improve your relationship with food and listen to your body's hunger cues.</p>
        <p class="article-content">
            In our fast-paced world, eating often becomes a secondary activityâ€”we eat while working, driving, or watching TV. Mindful eating, however, involves paying full attention to your foodâ€”how it looks, smells, and tastes. This practice helps you reconnect with your body's natural signals of hunger and fullness, preventing overeating and promoting a healthier relationship with food.
            <br><br>
            **Steps to practice mindful eating:**
            <ul>
                <li>**Slow down:** Put your fork down between bites and chew thoroughly.</li>
                <li>**Engage your senses:** Notice the colors, textures, aromas, and flavors of your meal.</li>
                <li>**Eliminate distractions:** Turn off the TV and put away your phone.</li>
                <li>**Listen to your body:** Pay attention to how you feel as you eat. Are you truly hungry? When do you start to feel full?</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="article-title">Quick Workouts for a Busy Schedule</h3>
        <p class="article-summary">Don't have time for a long gym session? A 15-minute high-intensity workout can be just as effective. We share some simple routines you can do anywhere, anytime.</p>
        <p class="article-content">
            Finding time for exercise can be a challenge, but a short, intense workout can provide significant benefits. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods. This method burns calories in less time and can improve cardiovascular fitness.
            <br><br>
            **Simple 15-minute HIIT routine:**
            <ol>
                <li>**Warm-up:** 3 minutes of light jogging or jumping jacks.</li>
                <li>**Workout:** Repeat the following circuit 3 times with 30 seconds rest between sets:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Jumping jacks (45 seconds)</li>
                        <li>Push-ups (45 seconds)</li>
                        <li>Squats (45 seconds)</li>
                        <li>Plank (45 seconds)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>**Cool-down:** 3 minutes of stretching.</li>
            </ol>
            Remember, consistency is key. Even a short workout is better than no workout at all.
